                <p>Welcome to <strong>Mailvex</strong>. Your privacy is not just a feature for us; it is our primary mission. This Privacy Policy document outlines the types of personal information that is received and collected by Mailvex and how it is used. As a provider of disposable temporary email services, we operate on a principle of <strong>Data Minimization</strong> and <strong>Total Anonymity</strong>.</p>

                <h2>1. Our Privacy Philosophy</h2>
                <p>Most internet services are built to collect as much data as possible. Mailvex is built to collect as little as possible. We believe that you should be able to browse the internet, verify accounts, and download content without leaving a digital trail that follows you for years. Our service is designed to be a "buffer" between your real identity and the untrusted corners of the web.</p>

                <h2>2. Information We DO NOT Collect</h2>
                <p>To understand what we do collect, it is important to first understand what we ignore. Unlike traditional email providers (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook), Mailvex does NOT require or collect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your legal name or aliases.</li>
                    <li>Your physical address or location.</li>
                    <li>Your phone number for SMS verification.</li>
                    <li>Any secondary "recovery" email addresses.</li>
                    <li>Your IP address (we do not log IP addresses in association with generated emails).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Information We Process</h2>
                <p>To provide a functional service, we must process certain technical data. However, this data is transient and often volatile.</p>
                
                <h3>3.1 Temporary Email Data</h3>
                <p>When you generate a temporary address, our system creates a placeholder in our database. Any emails sent to that address are stored on our servers. <strong>Crucially:</strong> These emails are stored only for a short duration. Once you delete the email address manually or the session expires due to inactivity, the emails are purged. We do not keep backups or archives of deleted emails.</p>

                <h3>3.2 Technical Logs</h3>
                <p>Like almost all websites, we use log files. The information inside the log files includes browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and the number of clicks. This information is <strong>anonymous</strong> and is used to analyze trends, administer the site, and track the system's health. It is never linked to a specific person's identity.</p>

                <h2>4. Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>
                <p>Mailvex uses cookies to store information about visitors' preferences and to record user-specific information on which pages the user accesses or visits. This helps us customize the user experience. For example, a cookie might remember which temporary email address is currently active in your browser so that if you refresh the page, you don't lose your inbox.</p>

                <h3>4.1 Third-Party Advertising Partners</h3>
                <p>We use third-party advertising companies (such as Adsterra) to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These third-party ad servers use technology to the advertisements and links that appear on Mailvex send directly to your browsers. They automatically receive your IP address when this occurs.</p>
                <p>Please note that Mailvex has no access to or control over these cookies that are used by third-party advertisers. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers for more detailed information.</p>

                <h2>5. Data Security Protocols</h2>
                <p>We take the security of your temporary data very seriously. Mailvex employs several layers of protection:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SSL Encryption:</strong> All data transmitted between your device and our servers is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</li>
                    <li><strong>Volatile Storage:</strong> We prioritize keeping email data in RAM (Random Access Memory) rather than on permanent hard drives whenever possible, ensuring that a simple server restart can wipe data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automated Purging:</strong> Our system runs "cleanup" scripts every few minutes to ensure that expired addresses and their associated emails are permanently removed from the system.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Your Rights (GDPR & CCPA Compliance)</h2>
                <p>Even though we do not collect personal identifiers, we respect global privacy standards like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> You can delete your temporary email and all its content at any time by clicking the "Delete" button.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Anonymity:</strong> You are never required to provide real data to use our service.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> Since the data is temporary and self-destructing, we do not offer a "download my data" feature, as the data is designed to be throwaway.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Mailvex does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian believes that Mailvex has in its database the personally-identifiable information of a child under the age of 13, please contact us immediately, and we will use our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.</p>

                <h2>8. External Links</h2>
                <p>Our website may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.</p>

                <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
                <p>Mailvex reserves the right to update or change this Privacy Policy at any time. We will notify users of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

                <h2>10. Consent</h2>
                <p>By using our website, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, please do not use our temporary email services.</p>

                <h2 class="border-none">11. Contact Us</h2>
                <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at <strong>jhonhamare@gmail.com</strong>.</p>
