                <p>This Cookie Policy explains what cookies are and how <strong>Mailvex</strong> uses them. You should read this policy so you can understand what type of cookies we use, or the information we collect using cookies and how that information is used. This policy is part of our commitment to transparency and user privacy.</p>

                <h2>1. What are Cookies?</h2>
                <p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your browser or the hard drive of your computer or mobile device when you visit a webpage or application. Cookies work to make your experience browsing our site as smooth as possible and they remember your preferences so you don’t have to insert your details again and again.</p>
                <p>There are different types of cookies. Some cookies come directly from our website and others come from third parties which place cookies on our site. These cookies are stored for different periods, such as "session cookies" (which last only while your browser is open) and "persistent cookies" (which stay on your device until they expire or you delete them).</p>

                <h2>2. How We Use Cookies</h2>
                <p>At Mailvex, we use cookies for several critical reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Essential Functionality:</strong> To keep your temporary email session active. Without these cookies, if you refreshed the page, you would lose access to your current inbox.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> To detect and prevent fraudulent use of our services and protect your data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> To understand how users interact with our site so we can fix bugs and improve the loading speed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> To help us fund our free service by showing relevant advertisements.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Categories of Cookies We Use</h2>
                
                <h3>3.1 Necessary Cookies</h3>
                <p>These cookies are essential for you to browse the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the site. Without these cookies, services like generating a temporary email address cannot be provided. These do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you’ve been on the internet.</p>

                <h3>3.2 Preference Cookies</h3>
                <p>Also known as "functionality cookies," these allow our website to remember choices you have made in the past, like what language you prefer or what your username and password are so you can automatically log in (if applicable).</p>

                <h3>3.3 Advertising and Tracking Cookies</h3>
                <p>We use third-party advertising partners, specifically <strong>Adsterra</strong>, to serve advertisements when you visit Mailvex. These partners use cookies and web beacons to serve ads based on your previous visits to our website or other websites on the internet. This technology allows them to recognize your IP address and serve ads that are more relevant to your interests.</p>

                <h2>4. Controlling Your Cookies</h2>
                <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted.</p>
                <p>Most browsers allow you to:</p>

                </ul>
